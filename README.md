# Hi, I'm Kevin

### Junior Frontend Developer

I build functional **web apps and plugins** with strong focus on:
-  JavaScript & TypeScript
-  Component-based architecture in Vue 3
-  Clean UI and **creative design systems**
-  Modular SCSS and responsive styling

I enjoy turning ideas into polished frontends — **creativity and UI design are my favorite part of development**.
